This food delivery app was made based on the [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAXQh_Zk9Kk&list=PLAP1EsuzlGNJYvsJzRE8owOzWEhIuZe3i) of Efficient Programming

## What are the features of FoodTrip.

FoodTrip is an app designed for food delivery, created using React Native. With FoodTrip, users can register and log in using their email and password, or opt for the convenience of using the Google popup registration and login method. The app's homepage is equipped with both bottom and drawer navigators, which allows users to seamlessly move around the platform. The homepage also features a slider category section, as well as a popular and featured restaurant section, giving users a wide range of restaurant options.

The search page on FoodTrip includes a list of categories presented in cards, with a search bar located at the top where users can input a specific query to search for a particular category. Once a category is selected, a list of restaurants carrying the same products will be displayed. On the restaurant page, users can choose from a specific menu and add their selection to their cart. A map feature is also available on the homepage, allowing users to track their orders in real-time.

FoodTrip's "My Orders" page provides access to both current and past orders, while the "My Account" page is where users can update their personal information. With the drawer navigator, users can easily navigate to the admin stacks, rider stacks, or user stacks, depending on their needs. Finally, the app allows users to log out whenever they're finished using the platform.

## What went well

Developing FoodTrip enabled me to enhance my knowledge of React Native concepts, particularly in creating stack navigators, bottom tab navigators, and drawer navigators.

## What are the challenges encountered

Efficient Programmer ceased working on the tutorial before completing the application, leaving it only halfway done. I managed to replicate the designs of each page by retracing his steps, but I am still in the process of learning enough to integrate the required functionalities.

## Future improvements

My plan is to execute all the functionalities that Efficient Programming had in mind for this app, which includes creating an admin panel, rider app, and integrating all these elements into one comprehensive application. To gain a better understanding of the necessary processes and logic required to accomplish these goals, I am currently following the Amazon clone tutorial of notjust.dev youtube channel.
